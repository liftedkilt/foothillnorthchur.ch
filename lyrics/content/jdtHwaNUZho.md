Eternal God, unchanging<br />
Mysterious, and unknown<br />
Your boundless love, unfailing<br />
In grace and mercy shown<br />
<br />
Bright Seraphim in endless flight<br />
Around Your glorious throne<br />
They raise their voices day and night<br />
In praise to You alone<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
<br />
Lord, we are weak and frail<br />
Helpless in the storm<br />
Surround us with Your angels<br />
Hold us in Your arms<br />
<br />
Our cold and ruthless enemy<br />
His pleasure is our harm<br />
Rise up, oh, Lord and he will flee<br />
Before our sovereign God<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
<br />
Let every creature in the sea<br />
And every flying bird<br />
Let every mountain, every field<br />
And valley of the earth<br />
<br />
Let all the moons and all the stars<br />
In all the universe<br />
Sing praises to the living God<br />
Who rules them by His Word<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
Hallelujah<br />
Glory be to our great God<br />
