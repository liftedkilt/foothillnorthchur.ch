Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart<br />
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art<br />
Thou my best thought by day or by night<br />
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light<br />

Be Thou my wisdom, and Thou my true word<br />
I ever with Thee and Thou with me Lord<br />
Thou my great Father and I Thy true son<br />
Thou in me dwelling and I with Thee one<br />

Riches I need not, nor man's empty praise<br />
Thou mine inheritance now and always<br />
Thou and Thou only first in my heart<br />
High king of heaven my treasure Thou art<br />

Be Thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart<br />
Nought be all else to me, save that Thou art<br />
Thou my best thought by day or by night<br />
Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light<br />

High king of heaven, my victory won<br />
May I reach heaven's joy, bright heaven sun<br />
Heart of my own heart, whatever befall<br />
Still be my vision, oh ruler of all<br />

Still be my vision, oh ruler of all<br />
