**VERSE 1**<br />
I once was lost in darkest night<br />
Yet thought I knew the way<br />
The sin that promised joy and life<br />
Had led me to the grave<br />
I had no hope that You would own<br />
A rebel to Your will<br />
And if You had not loved me first<br />
I would refuse You still<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
But as I ran my hell-bound race<br />
Indifferent to the cost<br />
You looked upon my helpless state<br />
And led me to the cross<br />
And I beheld Godâ€™s love displayed<br />
You suffered in my place<br />
You bore the wrath reserved for me<br />
Now all I know is grace<br />
<br />
**CHORUS**<br />
Hallelujah! All I have is Christ<br />
Hallelujah! Jesus is my life<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone<br />
And live so all might see<br />
The strength to follow Your commands<br />
Could never come from me<br />
O Father, use my ransomed life<br />
In any way You choose<br />
And let my song forever be<br />
My only boast is You<br />
