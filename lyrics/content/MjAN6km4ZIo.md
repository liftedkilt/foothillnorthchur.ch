**VERSE 1**<br />
Alas! and did my Savior bleed<br />
Snd did my Sovereign die?<br />
Would He devote that sacred head<br />
For such a worm as I?<br />
Was it for crimes that I had done<br />
He groaned upon the tree?<br />
Amazing pity, grace unknown,<br />
And love beyond degree!<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
Well might the sun in darkness hide<br />
And shut His glories in<br />
When Christ the mighty Maker died<br />
For man the creature’s sin.<br />
Thus might I hide my blushing face<br />
While His dear cross appears;<br />
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness<br />
And melt my eyes with tears.<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
But drops of grief can ne’er repay<br />
The debt of love I owe;<br />
Here, Lord, I give myself away,<br />
‘Tis all that I can do.<br />
Alas! and did my Savior bleed<br />
And did my Sovereign die?<br />
Amazing pity, grace unknown,<br />
And love beyond degree!<br />
