Creation sings the Father’s song;<br />
He calls the sun to wake the dawn<br />
And run the course of day<br />
Till evening falls in crimson rays.<br />
His fingerprints in flakes of snow,<br />
His breath upon this spinning globe,<br />
He charts the eagle’s flight;<br />
Commands the newborn baby’s cry.<br />

*CHORUS*<br />
Hallelujah! Let all creation stand and sing,<br />
”Hallelujah!” Fill the earth with songs of worship;<br />
Tell the wonders of creation’s King.<br />

Creation gazed upon His face;<br />
The ageless One in time’s embrace<br />
Unveiled the Father’s plan<br />
Of reconciling God and man.<br />
A second Adam walked the earth,<br />
Whose blameless life would break the curse,<br />
Whose death would set us free<br />
To live with Him eternally.<br />

Creation longs for His return,<br />
When Christ shall reign upon the earth;<br />
The bitter wars that rage<br />
Are birth pains of a coming age.<br />
When He renews the land and sky,<br />
All heav’n will sing and earth reply<br />
With one resplendent theme: The glories of our God and King!
