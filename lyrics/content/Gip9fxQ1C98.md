**Verse 1**<br />
Christ the sure and steady anchor, in the fury of the storm<br />
When the winds of doubt blow through me, and my sails have all been torn<br />
In the suff'ring, in the sorrow, when my sinking hopes are few<br />
I will hold fast to the anchor, it shall never be removed<br />

**Verse 2**<br />
Christ the sure and steady anchor, while the tempest rages on<br />
When temptation claims the battle, and it seems the night has won<br />
Deeper still then goes the anchor, though I justly stand accused<br />
I will hold fast to the anchor, it shall never be removed<br />

*Interlude*<br />

**Verse 3**<br />
Christ the sure and steady anchor, through the floods of unbelief<br />
Hopeless somehow, O my soul now, lift your eyes to Calvary<br />
This my ballast of assurance, see His love forever proved<br />
I will hold fast to the anchor, it shall never be removed<br />

**Verse 4**<br />
Christ the sure and steady anchor, as we face the wave of death<br />
When these trials give way to glory, and we draw our final breath<br />
We will cross that great horizon, clouds behind and life secure<br />
And the calm will be the better, for the storms that we endure<br />

**Outro**<br />
Christ the shore of our salvation, ever faithful ever true<br />
We will hold fast to the anchor, it shall never be removed
