**VERSE 1**<br />
Come praise and glorify our God<br />
The Father of our Lord<br />
In Christ He has in heav’nly realms<br />
His blessings on us poured<br />
For pure and blameless in His sight<br />
He destined us to be<br />
And now we’ve been adopted through<br />
His Son eternally<br />
<br />
**CHORUS**<br />
To the praise of Your glory<br />
To the praise of Your mercy and grace<br />
To the praise of Your glory<br />
You are the God who saves<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
Come praise and glorify our God<br />
Who gives His grace in Christ<br />
In Him our sins are washed away<br />
Redeemed through sacrifice<br />
In Him God has made known to us<br />
The myst’ry of His will<br />
That Christ should be the head of all<br />
His purpose to fulfill<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
Come praise and glorify our God<br />
For we’ve believed the Word<br />
And through our faith we have a seal<br />
The Spirit of the Lord<br />
The Spirit guarantees our hope<br />
Until redemption’s done<br />
Until we join in endless praise<br />
To God, the Three in One<br />
