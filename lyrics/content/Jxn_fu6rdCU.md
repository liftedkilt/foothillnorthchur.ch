Who else commands all the hosts of heaven<br />
Who else could make every king bow down<br />
Who else can whisper and darkness trembles<br />
Only a Holy God<br />

What other beauty demands such praises<br />
What other splendour outshines the sun<br />
What other majesty rules with justice<br />
Only a Holy God<br />

Come and behold Him<br />
The One and the Only<br />
Cry out, sing holy<br />
Forever a Holy God<br />

Come and worship the Holy God<br />
What other glory consumes like fire<br />
What other power can raise the dead<br />
What other name remains undefeated<br />
Only a Holy God<br />

Who else could rescue me from my failing<br />
Who else would offer His only Son<br />
Who else invites me to call Him Father<br />
Only a Holy God<br />

Only my Holy God!<br />
