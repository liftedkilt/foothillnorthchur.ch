Behold the Lamb who bears our sins away,<br />
Slain for us - and we remember<br />
The promise made that all who come in faith<br />
Find forgiveness at the cross. <br />
So we share in this bread of life, <br />
And we drink of His sacrifice <br />
As a sign of our bonds of peace <br />
Around the table of the King. <br />
<br />
The body of our Saviour Jesus Christ, <br />
Torn for you - eat and remember <br />
The wounds that heal, the death that brings us life <br />
Paid the price to make us one. <br />
So we share in this bread of life, <br />
And we drink of His sacrifice <br />
As a sign of our bonds of love <br />
Around the table of the King. <br />
<br />
The blood that cleanses every stain of sin, <br />
Shed for you - drink and remember <br />
He drained death’s cup that all may enter in <br />
To receive the life of God. <br />
So we share in this bread of life, <br />
And we drink of His sacrifice <br />
As a sign of our bonds of grace <br />
Around the table of the King. <br />
<br />
And so with thankfulness and faith we rise <br />
To respond, - and to remember <br />
Our call to follow in the steps of Christ <br />
As His body here on earth. <br />
As we share in His suffering <br />
We proclaim Christ will come again!<br />
And we’ll join in the feast of heaven <br />
Around the table of the King<br />
