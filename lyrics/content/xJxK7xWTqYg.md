**VERSE 1**
Eternal God, unchanging, 
Mysterious and unknown;
Your boundless love, unfailing,
In grace and mercy shown.
Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight
Around Your glorious throne;
They raise their voices day
And night in praise to You alone!

**CHORUS**
Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!
Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!

**VERSE 2**
Lord, we are weak and frail
And are helpless in the storm;
Surround us with Your angels
And hold us in Your arms.
Our cold and ruthless enemy,
His pleasure is our harm.
Rise up, O Lord, and he will flee
Before our sovereign God.

**VERSE 3**
Let every creature in the sea
And every flying bird,
Let every mountain, every field, 
And valley of the earth, 
Let all the moons and all the stars 
In all the universe 
Sing praises to the living God 
Who rules them by His Word.
