**VERSE 1**<br />
Eternal God, unchanging,<br />
Mysterious and unknown;<br />
Your boundless love, unfailing,<br />
In grace and mercy shown.<br />
Bright seraphim in ceaseless flight<br />
Around Your glorious throne;<br />
They raise their voices day<br />
And night in praise to You alone!<br />

**CHORUS**<br />
Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!<br />
Hallelujah! Glory be to our great God!<br />

**VERSE 2**<br />
Lord, we are weak and frail<br />
And are helpless in the storm;<br />
Surround us with Your angels<br />
And hold us in Your arms.<br />
Our cold and ruthless enemy,<br />
His pleasure is our harm.<br />
Rise up, O Lord, and he will flee<br />
Before our sovereign God.<br />

**VERSE 3**<br />
Let every creature in the sea<br />
And every flying bird,<br />
Let every mountain, every field, <br />
And valley of the earth, <br />
Let all the moons and all the stars <br />
In all the universe <br />
Sing praises to the living God <br />
Who rules them by His Word.
