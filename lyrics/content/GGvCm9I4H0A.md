Come, ye sinners, poor and needy<br />
Weak and wounded, sick and sore<br />
Jesus ready, stands to save you<br />
Full of pity, love and power<br />

I will arise and go to Jesus<br />
He will embrace me in His arms<br />
In the arms of my dear Savior<br />
Oh, there are ten thousand charms<br />

Come, ye thirsty, come and welcome<br />
God's free bounty glorify<br />
True belief and true repentance<br />
Every grace that brings you nigh<br />

Come, ye weary, heavy-laden<br />
Lost and ruined by the fall<br />
If you tarry 'til you're better<br />
You will never come at all<br />

I will arise and go to Jesus<br />
He will embrace me in His arms<br />
In the arms of my dear Savior<br />
Oh, there are ten thousand charms<br />

Feel Him Prostate in the garden<br />
On the ground your Maker lies<br />
On the bloody tree, behold him<br />
Sinner, will this not suffice?<br />

Lo, the incarnate God ascended<br />
Pleads the merit of his blood<br />
Venture on him, venture wholly<br />
Let no other trust intrude<br />

I will arise and go to Jesus<br />
He will embrace me in His arms<br />
In the arms of my dear Savior<br />
In the arms of my dear Savior<br />
In the arms of my dear Savior<br />
Oh, there are ten thousand charms<br />
