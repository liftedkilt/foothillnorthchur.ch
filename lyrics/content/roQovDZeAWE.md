Mine are days that God has numbered<br />
I was made to walk with Him

Yet I look for worldly treasure<br />
And forsake the King of kings

But mine is hope in my Redeemer<br />
Though I fall, his love is sure

For Christ has paid for every failing<br />
I am His forevermore

Mine are tears in times of sorrow<br />
Darkness not yet understood

Through the valley I must travel<br />
Where I see no earthly good

But mine is peace that flows from heaven<br />
And the strength in times of need

I know my pain will not be wasted<br />
Christ completes his work in me

Mine are days here as a stranger<br />
Pilgrim on a narrow way

One with Christ I will encounter<br />
Harm and hatred for his name

But mine is armour for this battle<br />
Strong enough to last the war

And he has said he will deliver<br />
Safely to the golden shore

And mine are keys to Zion city<br />
Where beside the King I walk

For there my heart has found its treasure<br />
Christ is mine forevermore

Come rejoice now, O my soul<br />
For his love is my reward

Fear is gone and hope is sure<br />
Christ is mine forevermore!
