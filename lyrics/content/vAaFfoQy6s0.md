**VERSE 1**<br />
As morning dawns and day awakes,<br />
To You I bring my need<br />
O gracious God, my source of strength,<br />
In You I live and breathe<br />
Each hour is Yours by wisdom planned,<br />
Each deed empowered by sovereign hands<br />
Renew my spirit, help me stand;<br />
Be glorified today<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
As day unfolds, I seek Your will<br />
In all of lifeâ€™s demands<br />
And though the tempter tries me still,<br />
I cling to Your commands<br />
Let every effort of my life<br />
Display the matchless worth of Christ<br />
Make me a living sacrifice;<br />
Be glorified today<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
As sun gives way to darkest night<br />
Your Spirit still is here<br />
And though my strength fades like the light<br />
New mercies will appear<br />
I rest in You; abide with me<br />
Until our trials and suffering<br />
Give way to final victory<br />
Be glorified, today; be glorified, I pray<br />
