**Verse 1**<br />
I do not ask to see the way<br />
my feet will have to tread;<br />
But only that my soul may feed<br />
upon the living bread.<br />
‘Tis better far that I should walk<br />
by faith close to His side,<br />
I may not know the way I go,<br />
but oh, I know my Guide.<br />

**Chorus**<br />
His love can never fail,<br />
His love can never fail;<br />
My soul is satisfied to know<br />
His love can never fail.<br />

**Verse 2**<br />
And if my feet would go astray,<br />
they cannot, for I know<br />
that Jesus guides my falt’ring steps<br />
as joyfully I go.<br />
And tho’ I may not see His face,<br />
my faith is strong and clear<br />
that in each hour of sore distress<br />
my Savior will be near.<br />

*Chorus*

**Verse 3**<br />
I will not fear, tho’ darkness come<br />
abroad o’er all the land,<br />
if I may only feel the touch<br />
of His own loving hand.<br />
And tho’ I tremble when I think<br />
how weak I am, how frail,<br />
my soul is satisfied to know<br />
His love can never fail.<br />

*Chorus*
