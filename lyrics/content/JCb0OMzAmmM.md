VERSE 1<br />
Once a slave to the fear and the darkness held within<br />
O the weight of my sin, my shame<br />
By His grace purified, in redeeming sacrifice<br />
Living hope that wonâ€™t spoil or fade<br />
<br />
CHORUS 1<br />
I am washed by the blood of the Son on the cross<br />
I am washed by the blood of the Lamb<br />
All my guilt, all my shame <br />
were His wounds and His pain<br />
I am washed by the blood of the Lamb<br />
<br />
VERSE 2<br />
Now we know who we are, precious children called by God<br />
Let us serve and exalt our King<br />
With our hearts and our minds freely offer up our lives<br />
Run the race fix our gaze on Him<br />
<br />
CHORUS 2<br />
We are washed by the blood of the Son on the cross<br />
We are washed by the blood of the Lamb<br />
All our guilt, all our shame <br />
were his wounds and his pain<br />
We are washed by the blood of the Lamb<br />
<br />
VERSE 3<br />
We will rise as He rose, for the grave no longer holds<br />
Every tear will be wiped away<br />
And the saints will be heard, praising God forevermore<br />
Face to face with the One who saves<br />
