**VERSE 1**<br />
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br />
Greatest treasure of my longing soul<br />
My God, like You there is no other<br />
True delight is found in You alone<br />
Your grace, a well too deep to fathom<br />
Your love exceeds the heavensâ€™ reach<br />
Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom<br />
My highest good and my unending need<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br />
Strong defender of my weary heart<br />
My sword to fight the cruel deceiver<br />
And my shield against his hateful darts<br />
My song when enemies surround me<br />
My hope when tides of sorrow rise<br />
My joy when trials are abounding<br />
Your faithfulness, my refuge in the night<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br />
Gracious Savior of my ruined life<br />
My guilt and cross laid on Your shoulders<br />
In my place You suffered bled and died<br />
You rose, the grave and death are conquered<br />
You broke my bonds of sin and shame<br />
O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer<br />
May all my days bring glory to Your Name<br />
