In Christ alone my hope is found<br />
He is my light, my strength, my song<br />
This cornerstone, this solid ground,<br />
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm.<br />
What heights of love, what depths of peace,<br />
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease!<br />
My comforter, my all in all<br />
Here in the love of Christ I stand.<br />

In Christ alone, Who took on flesh,<br />
Fullness of God in helpless babe!<br />
This gift of love and righteousness,<br />
Scorned by the ones He came to save.<br />
'Til on that cross as Jesus died,<br />
The wrath of God was satisfied<br />
For ev'ry sin on Him was laid<br />
Here in the death of Christ I live.<br />

There in the ground His body lay,<br />
Light of the world by darkness slain<br />
Then bursting forth in glorious day,<br />
Up from the grave He rose again!<br />
And as He stands in victory,<br />
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me<br />
For I am His and He is mine<br />
Bought with the precious blood of Christ.<br />

No guilt in life, no fear in death<br />
This is the pow'r of Christ in me<br />
From life's first cry to final breath,<br />
Jesus commands my destiny.<br />
No pow'r of hell, no scheme of man,<br />
Can ever pluck me from His hand<br />
'Til He returns or calls me home<br />
Here in the pow'r of Christ I'll stand.<br />
