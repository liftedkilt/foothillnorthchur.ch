**Verse 1**<br />
Oh sing my soul the ancient song<br />
And lend your highest praise<br />
To Him who is the king of old<br />
And dwells in endless days<br />
How resplendent His glory<br />
How majestic His name<br />
Now to the uncreated One<br />
Oh let the anthem raise<br />
 <br />
**Verse 2**<br />
O worship Him our Father God<br />
The Spirit and the Word<br />
Who fashioned all things from His joy<br />
And saw that it was good<br />
What perfection of friendship<br />
What communion we shared<br />
But choosing death we fell from life<br />
Aside the guily pair<br />
 <br />
**Verse 3**<br />
Now hear my soul the gospel song<br />
Attend the joyful news<br />
For Christ has come the perfect Son<br />
His Fatherâ€™s will to choose<br />
In our place He did suffer<br />
In our place became sin<br />
The death of death the death of Christ<br />
Who stands alive again<br />
 <br />
**Verse 4**<br />
Now people of the risen Lord<br />
O hear the call to go<br />
Into the world we have been sent<br />
As messengers of hope<br />
Christ alone be our treasure<br />
Christ alone our reward<br />
Come bid the nations sing with us<br />
The praises of the Lord<br />
