**VERSE 1**<br />
Deliver us from evil, Lord;<br />
We sojourn in a broken world<br />
Though evil hands give rise to war,<br />
Remind us this is not our home<br />
We look to You, we look to You,<br />
Sovereign King of all the earth<br />
We look to You, we look to You;<br />
In Your strength we will endure<br />
In Your strength we will endure<br />
<br />
**VERSE 2**<br />
Deliver us from evil, Lord;<br />
Our hearts so quickly run astray<br />
Temptation crouching at the door<br />
To turn us from the narrow way<br />
We look to You, we look to You,<br />
Christ the conquering Son of God<br />
We look to You, we look to You;<br />
Lord, complete what You’ve begun<br />
Lord, complete what You’ve begun<br />
<br />
**VERSE 3**<br />
Deliver us from evil, Lord;<br />
The devil’s seeking to devour<br />
With trembling hearts we hear his roar,<br />
But Your strong arm will crush his pow’r<br />
We look to You, we look to You,<br />
Come and end his earthly reign<br />
We look to You, we look to You;<br />
Lord, deliver us, we pray<br />
<br />
**TAG**<br />
We look to You, we look to You<br />
You will come again to reign<br />
We look to You, we look to You<br />
All the earth will bow in praise<br />
